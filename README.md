# Power BI Report Factory

An AI-powered system for generating production-grade Power BI reports using a fintech-grade design system, industry-specific KPI packs, and Claude Code/Cursor orchestration.

**Author**: hturbano

## What This Is

A complete framework that takes a data source and a description, and produces a polished, fintech-quality Power BI report (.pbip) — using AI to handle the heavy lifting while maintaining design consistency through a codified design system.

This isn't a template. It's a **report factory**: design tokens as code, industry-specific KPI packs, battle-tested DAX patterns, and an AI skill file that encodes BI best practices into a repeatable workflow.

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by the clean, data-dense aesthetics of fintech leaders like Credit Karma and TurboTax:

- **Bold KPI cards** with large values and clear hierarchy
- **Deep navy + teal** color palette with semantic status colors
- **Rounded corners, subtle shadows, generous whitespace**
- **Light/dark theme toggle** built into every report
- **Industry-specific KPI packs** with smart field mapping

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hturbano/powerbi.git
cd powerbi
```

### 1b. Install the Skill

Claude Code and Cursor do **not** auto-load arbitrary markdown — they discover skills
in a `skills/` directory. Install the skill so it can trigger:

**Claude Code** (user-level, available in every project):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/powerbi-designer
cp ai-orchestration/skills/powerbi-designer.md ~/.claude/skills/powerbi-designer/SKILL.md
```

Or project-level (this repo only): copy it to `.claude/skills/powerbi-designer/SKILL.md`.

> **Note:** MCP servers load when the editor starts. After running the MCP setup
> below, **restart Claude Code / Cursor** in this folder so the servers are available.

### 2. Onboarding

When you first open the project, the skill will offer three paths:

```
Welcome to the Power BI Report Factory.

How would you like to get started?

  [A] I have an existing .pbip file — extract the design system from it
  [B] I want to build a design system from scratch — guide me through it
  [C] Use the default fintech theme — get me started immediately

Or type "wizard" for a step-by-step guided setup.
```

### 3. Set Up MCP Servers

```bash
bash scripts/setup-mcp.sh
```

### 4. Generate Your First Report

> **Prerequisite:** `powerbi-report-mcp` *edits* a PBIR report — it connects to an
> existing `.pbip` / `.Report` folder and does not scaffold one from nothing. Create
> a blank report in **Power BI Desktop** (File → Save as `.pbip`, enabling the PBIR
> format) first, then point the skill at that folder. The semantic model is managed
> by `powerbi-modeling-mcp`.
>
> **Enhanced PBIR required:** the `.Report` folder must contain a `definition/`
> subfolder (enhanced PBIR). Legacy `.pbip` files store a single root `report.json`
> and will fail to connect (`No .Report folder found`). Convert once in Power BI
> Desktop — see [docs/GOTCHAS.md](docs/GOTCHAS.md#report-must-be-in-enhanced-pbir-format-definition-folder).
> Also close Power BI Desktop before a batch of MCP edits so saves don't clobber them.

```
Build an education dashboard using the Education KPI pack with:
- KPI cards for enrollment, ADA rate, and graduation rate
- Monthly attendance trend
- Campus breakdown
- Light/dark theme toggle
```
